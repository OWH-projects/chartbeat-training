#Omaha.com traffic and analytics

In this week's brown-bag session, we'll take a look at Omaha.com stats and traffic. 
 
-- How do we decide which stories go on the home page?
-- What's the most popular time of day on the site? 
-- How often to people visit Omaha.com?
-- Where do Omaha.com readers live? 
-- How many people are reading our stories on Facebook and Twitter?
-- What percentage of Omaha.com traffic comes from mobile devices?
 
I'll go through Chartbeat and Google Analytics to show how the online team watches site traffic. 
 
And we'll talk about why some social media posts get more clicks than others.
 
No computer required. Bring your questions.
 
Large conference room, Wednesday at 1 p.m.
